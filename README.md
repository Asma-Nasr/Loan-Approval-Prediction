# Loan Approval Prediction
Task 2 @Elevvo ML Internship
## Instructions
1. Dataset (Recommended): Loan-Approval-Prediction-Dataset ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)).
2. Build a model to predict whether a loan application will be approved.
3. Handle missing values and encode categorical features.
4. Train a classification model and evaluate performance on imbalanced data.
5. Focus on precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. 
### Bonus:
1. Use SMOTE or other techniques to address class imbalance.
2. Try logistic regression vs. decision tree.
